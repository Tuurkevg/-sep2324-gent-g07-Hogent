      <p>
        You find yourself in a cave, and in this cave, you see only one thing! A
        DRAGON! Luckily, it's asleep. You could leave it alone, but you're a bit
        of a pest and can't resist poking it a few times!
      </p>
      <p>
        You convince yourself that if you can poke the dragon 5 times, you will
        feel successful in your life! And I don't need to explain why this is
        something you want, do I?!
